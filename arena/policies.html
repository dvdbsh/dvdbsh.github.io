        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Arena is committed to providing a workplace where all employees are treated with dignity and <span class="important">respect</span>.

        <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
        <h3>Professionalism and Respect</h3>
        <p>All employees are expected to conduct themselves professionally and courteously in all interactions at the workplace and any work-related functions. Respectful communication is essential.

        <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
        <p>Employees are encouraged to resolve conflicts respectfully and professionally. Seek assistance from a supervisor if conflicts escalate or if you feel unable to resolve them directly. Supervisors are responsible for intervening in conflicts and ensuring that they are addressed equitably and according to company policies.</p>

        <h3>Reporting Violations</h3>
        <p>Any employee who feels they have been subjected to language or behavior that violates this policy should report the incident to their supervisor or Human Resources immediately. The Arena ensures that all complaints will be investigated promptly and confidentially. Retaliation against any employee for reporting harassment or discrimination is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.</p>

        <h2>Enforcement</h2>
        <p>Violations of this policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>

        <h2>Commitment</h2>
